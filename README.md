## Welcome to My Coding Journey
Hi, my name is Tony and welcome to my blog,

where I will show every coding-related stuffs I did/have been doing/going to do.

Quick introduction, I am RMIT student, majoring in Information Technology and minor in Web Development (at least thatâ€™s what I plan anyway).

My dream is to become a Software Engineer and until then, I still have lots and lots to learn.
