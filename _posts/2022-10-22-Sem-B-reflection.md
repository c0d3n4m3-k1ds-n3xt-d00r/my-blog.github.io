## RMIT Vietnam Sem-B Reflection

It has only been half a year but so many things changed significantly. Funny how life turns out sometimes, especially in such a short time when you look back like this.

Also, I have deleted some of the previous posts due to how cringe and naive they are. If you have read those, I'm so sorry that you have to witness my past-self cringiness.

Anyway, where to start on the last 6 months, hmm..

Should I turn this post into a course review since my life is revolving around study now?

Ahh, fuck it, I will just write whatever comes first in my mind and what I remember then.

So, semester-B 2022 of RMIT, I took three courses: Intro to Computer System, User-centred Design and Security in Computer and Information Technology.

Ended up with 2 HDs and a 79 DI for UCD .-. Meh, in my defense, I do have a reason for getting that grade so..

Also, not an excuse for the past posts that I deleted but at that time, writing blog WAS the only way that I could vent my emotions, I did hold up a lot of emotions back then. I am much calmer now (I guess).

Okay let's get back to the topic for real. Course review with a mixture of past experiences it is!

I will review from the easiest in my opinion to the most frustrated course.

- Starting with UCD:
So 100% is divided into: Lab Tests (10%), Individual Assignment (45%) and Group Assignment (50%).
Honestly, this course may be defined as hard for others as I was lucky enough to have such a good team that we divided the parts equally. There were just a lot to do for the Group Assignment like doing reports, making a website prototype, making a Consent Form for Interviewing, conducting interviews, Q&A, and so on (Yeah, still more!). Therefore, it would be extremely hard if you have to carry the assignment so I would suggest you find a team ASAP and see their abilities. For me, again, I was lucky cuz I knew none of them and I got in thanks to this very blog.

About the course material, I think it's enough for you to do the assignment with a bit of creativity and researches as you have to analyze a website for the Individual Assignment and a Reflection essay after that. Thinking back, Jon is not bad as a lecturer, however, he did go off-topic by a lot so I would recommend you to read the suggested book on Canvas. Most of the slides content were also taken/inspired from it. Not to mention the book is very short, easy to read and interesting with only 150 pages.

Kinda ironic that I have the lowest grade for the easiest one, I actually got a very decent excuse for that, to the point that I only have 2 days to do the whole Assignment.

You see, I was kicked out of my rented house at that time, but not for the reason that you think. Sorry for my language since I am still mad when thinking back, I don't think I have ever hated a person more than the owner of that house before. At least it's all in the past now and I have avoided a huge fucking bomb. 
Here we go, long story short, the owner of the house, KDC Ven song duong so 8 nha 56, is a greedy BITCH, she kicked me out in a just a month as soon as she found another person with a better deal (like from 4.5mil/room she raised to 6mil/room IN A MONTH and the room is not even that good to begin with), with such bullshit and irrational reason like: You HAVE TO say hi to me whenever you go somewhere and even when I'm busy with something else. Excuse me??! We are fucking stranger, bro, if you wanna kick me just say it to my face, don't make up such bs reasons. And believe me, that's not the only bs, so that's that.
I was so stressed at that time with Assignments at Week 4 and house-hunting. 

Yeah so that's my reason for getting 79.

- Aight, for Security - taught by Dr. Shan Chen:
100% is divided into 3 Assignments: Indi 20%, Indi 30% and a Group 50%.

About the course material, to be honest, with all the lectures and slides, they are still not enough to get HD. Well they are enough if you are aiming for CR++ or DI. What I did before to get HD for all 3 was to read book, like actually read and understand the recommended book on the Canvas. I would suggest you to print it out and read it and brace yourself cuz that is a huge book with heavy theorectical concepts. Since I am really into Security, I had good time learning from the book, I wouldn't say it was enjoyable time though but give it a try. 

About Dr. Chen, I'd recommend you to actively participate in her lectures. And again, read book is an advantage because it allows you to speak in her language about Security like using the keywords and all that. Since this is the first time Dr. Chen taught this course, she is quite inexperienced but she is very helpful with the email replying and frequent Q&A, consultation session for the Assignments. I was lucky that my questions were mostly crucial as she updated the assignment info from the answers to my questions.

Now the group assignment is an interesting one, if you have already taken with Jon, well it doesn't look like that anymore, the whole structure changed. The assignment requires you to first apply what you learn to answer a question about secured techniques used, then writing a report in a specific format, the report topic was not easy as well since you have to theoretically design a blockchain system with diagrams and lots of researches and finally answer a followed - up question of that topic. 

Not gonna brag but I carried that one with re-phrasing the first question, reviewing and designing the system for the report.

Anyway, 81 HD.

- Finally, Intro to Computer System taught by Sam Goundar:
100% is divided into 2 In-class Tests and 2 Group Projects

About the course material, in my opinion, they are really dry and heavy theories that you have to remember all of them to do the in-class tests. Well if you are lucky enough to learn and review the correct part of the slides for the tests, it won't be that hard, however, it is usually not the case. Anyway, for the Tests, you just have to learn and understand those heavy theories as the Test 2 mostly takes what you have learned into an application question.

About the Group Projects, holy shit, the course materials are such a joke. They literally don't teach you anything at all about the electrical components, all they do is to provide some websites for the project ideas and that's it. And don't expect much from the Tutorials, they only have Q&A about how to get HD for the project without teaching you anything. 99% of the time you just have to teach yourself. I would recommend to expect the worst for the projects and start as early as possible because boy oh boy, a lot of components will not work or just fail even if you have strictly followed the Youtube video. The components that you borrowed from the school are honestly not good, like imagine how many people before you have used it, and they might be broken inside that you don't know. For the Micro:bit project, the coding is really easy but again, you have to teach yourself a lot about how the components work, what are their power requirements otherwise you could burn it.

With that being said, the course is really easy if you just aim for CR, especially the projects since you can just lookup a tutorial and 100% follow it with a bit of components research. For my case, my team did have many innovative ideas, I mean we even had Mr. Dat - our tutor - to take a selfie with us and our project so you can imagine how good it is, and also got graded 90. 

Anyway, 83 HD. But seriously, don't underestimate this course. It IS hard!

That will wrap up my course review. I learned a lot in the past semester, and I also made some good connections with others after the projects are done. For Sem-C, I'm taking:

- Building IT System
- Intro to IT
- Software Engineering Design
- Software Engineering Fundamentals

By the time I'm writing this blog, my sem break only has 1 day left. However, I really don't feel like sem break at all since I have already started learning about Frontend languages for 3 weeks now. You know, HTML/CSS/JS and React, and also prepare my C++ knowledge. Since I haven't taken Web Programming, I have to prepare myself ahead like that otherwise I would become a burden for my teammates. Impressive how people start looking for teammates as soon as Sem-B ended, literally no chill with my BITS course.
